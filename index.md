## About Me

From June 2023 to May 2025, I will work as a postdoc at <a href="https://www.lst.uni-saarland.de/"> Department of Language Science and Technology </a> in <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html"> Saarland University </a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/mywww/research.html"> Prof. Bernd Möbius</a> and in association with the <a href="https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/team/wei-xue/"> SFB 1102 group</a>. The postdoc research is funded by <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/rubicon"> NWO Rubicon grant</a>. In March 2023, I received my PhD from <a href="https://www.ru.nl/"> Radboud University</a>, The Netherlands, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/strik-w"> Dr. Helmer Strik</a>, <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/hout-r-van"> Prof. Roeland van Hout </a>, and <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/cucchiarini-c"> Dr. Catia Cucchiarini </a>. My PhD research was funded by the  <a href="https://www.tapas-etn-eu.org/"> EU H2020-ITN-ETN-MSCA *Training Network on Automatic Processing of PAthological Speech* (TAPAS) </a> project, <a href="https://www.tapas-etn-eu.org/Members/wei--xue/myblog"> and my PhD research </a> specifically focused on assessing the speech intelligibility of pathological speech. My recent work has focused on experimental methods to study aspects of speech production and perception. Another focus of my recent work is improving auotmatic speech recognition in the assessment of speech quality for impaired speech. In 2021, I conducted my secondment at the University Hospital of Antwerp (UZA) under the co-supervision of <a href="https://www.uza.be/persoon/mevr-gwen-van-nuffelen"> Prof. Gwen van Nuffelen</a>. I obtained my Master's degree from <a href="http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm"> Tianjin University </a> in 2017, and my Bachelor's degree from <a href="http://en.hainanu.edu.cn/ "> Hainan University </a> in 2014.
